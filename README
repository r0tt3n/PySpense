PySpense is a simple program for keeping track of your budget by calculating
your monthly income vs. monthly expenses.

A file of your income, expenses, and disposable income after expenses is
written to a file called expenses.txt in the folder where the script was run
from.

It is also my very first program in my very first language. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
